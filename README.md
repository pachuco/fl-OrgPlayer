AS3 port of Wedge of Cheese's Java Organya replayer. Why would anyone need one for AS3? Who knows...

Both Org-02 and Org-03 supported.



Current state:
Functional, more accurate than liborganya. Ungodly code mess.



TODO:

 *Some code clean.
 
 *Reproduce Organya's handling of melodic samples, per octave.
 
 *I changed my mind. This is gonna be a tracker instead of just a player.
 
 *Replace WoC's samplebank format with own, better one.
 
 *Deal with drumsample mapping(Xaser vs original OrgMaker v2 mapping) and 'Cave Story' mode.
 
 *Synthesize instruments from PXTs.
 
 *Port this back to C, where it's actually useful.
