AS3 port of Wedge of Cheese's Java Organya replayer. Why would anyone need one for AS3? Who knows...

Both Org-02 and Org-03 supported.



Current state:
Functional, more accurate than liborganya. Ungodly code mess.



TODO:

 *Use ORG headers, not discard them.
 
 *Clean up the code. Lots of things here.
 
 *Replace WoC's bank format with own, better one.
 
 *Synthesize instruments from PXTs.
 
 *Port this to C, where it's actually useful.
